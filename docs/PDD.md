## Application Overview: **TrailQuest**

**TrailQuest** is a freemium SaaS platform designed to synchronize the relationship between trainees, hikers, and fitness professionals. Unlike generic trackers, T&T focuses on **Muscle Load Visualization**, allowing users to see exactly which muscle groups are being taxed—whether they are at a squat rack or on a mountain trail.

The platform serves three primary roles:

1. **The Trainee:** Tracks workouts, hikes, and diet with visual muscle-group heatmaps.
2. **The Hiker:** Logs elevation and distance, translating trail data into physical "work" (e.g., heavy glute/calf engagement).
3. **The Trainer:** Monitors client progress, adjusts nutrition goals, and views recovery data through a dedicated dashboard.

## Epic 1: Muscle-Centric Activity Tracking

This epic focuses on the core logging functionality for both gym sessions and outdoor hikes.

- **User Story 1.1:** As a **Trainee**, I want to log my sets, reps, and weights for specific exercises so that I can track my strength progress over time.
- **User Story 1.2:** As a **Hiker**, I want to log my trail duration and elevation gain so the app can calculate the muscle load on my lower body.
- **User Story 1.3:** As a **User**, I want to see a "Muscle Heatmap" on my dashboard so that I can visually identify which muscles are overtrained or neglected.
- **User Story 1.4:** As a **User**, I want to log "Rest Days" and "Active Recovery" sessions so that my trainer knows I am prioritizing injury prevention.

## Epic 2: The Nutrition & Habit Tracker

Focuses on the dietary requirements requested by the trainer to ensure physical work is fueled correctly.

- **User Story 2.1:** As a **Trainee**, I want to log my daily meals and macro-nutrients so that I can stay within the targets set by my trainer.
- **User Story 2.2:** As a **User**, I want to track my daily water intake to ensure I am hydrated for weekend hikes.
- **User Story 2.3:** As a **Trainer**, I want to set specific caloric and protein goals for my clients so they have clear guidance on their nutrition.

## Epic 3: The Trainer-Client Portal

This is the B2B/Pro side of the SaaS model, allowing for remote coaching and accountability.

- **User Story 3.1:** As a **Trainee**, I want to grant my trainer secure access to my profile so they can view my workout logs and diet in real-time.
- **User Story 3.2:** As a **Trainer**, I want a "Client Overview" dashboard to see a list of all my trainees and flag those who haven't logged activity in 3+ days.
- **User Story 3.3:** As a **Trainer**, I want to leave comments or "form cues" on specific exercises my client logged to provide feedback remotely.

## Epic 4: Analytics & Optimization Dashboard

Advanced data visualization for users to optimize their fitness journey.

- **User Story 4.1:** As a **User**, I want to view a "Volume Trend" chart (Weight × Reps) so that I can confirm I am achieving progressive overload.
- **User Story 4.2:** As a **Hiker**, I want to see a correlation between my gym leg days and my hiking performance (speed/elevation) to see if my training is effective.
- **User Story 4.3:** As a **Freemium User**, I want to see which "Pro" analytics (like recovery scores) are available so I can decide if I want to upgrade to a paid subscription.

## Epic 5: SaaS Foundation & Monetization

The infrastructure required to run the app as a business.

- **User Story 5.1:** As a **New User**, I want to choose between a Free, Trainee Pro, or Trainer account during onboarding.

### Epic 6: Program Design & Prescription

This epic allows trainers to move from "watching" to "directing" by building workout and hiking schedules for their clients.

- **User Story 6.1:** As a **Trainer**, I want to create custom workout templates (sets, reps, rest intervals) so I can quickly assign them to multiple trainees.
- **User Story 6.2:** As a **Trainer**, I want to prescribe specific "Hiking Milestones" (e.g., _Reach 1,000ft elevation this Saturday_) to help my clients prepare for larger mountain goals.
- **User Story 6.3:** As a **Trainer**, I want to attach video demonstrations to exercises so my clients can verify their form when I'm not physically present.

### Epic 7: The "Mountain-Ready" Progress System

Since your trainees love hiking, this epic gamifies the transition from the gym to the trail.

- **User Story 7.1:** As a **Trainee**, I want to see a "Trail Readiness Score" based on my recent leg-day volume and cardio consistency.
- **User Story 7.2:** As a **Trainee**, I want to "Check-In" at a trailhead so the app can automatically start a hiking-specific muscle tracking session.
- **User Story 7.3:** As a **Trainee**, I want to earn "Peak Badges" for hitting specific elevation or distance milestones, which are then visible to my trainer.
